# Opioid-Overdose-Shiny-App

This app uses data from the CDC WONDER database to graph opioid related overdoses in the US.  The data is graphed for the US overall, and mapped by state when data is available.
Due to privacy laws, State level data cannot be published if doing so may reveal the identities of the deceased.  For this reason, the state level data has many more NA values than the data for the US.
